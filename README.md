# CAD Timeline
 Custom made CAD only for timeline tracking of events built in VB.net

 This was designed for the Raritan Township Fire Company in 2018 but this program was never used in service.
 
 It creates a text file in the directory you run the .exe from containing the entries you enter.
 
 It should timestamp any entries you make and automatically convert anything you enter into capital letters.
 
 Issues:
 -You cannot edit the files from within the GUI, you must edit them outside of the GUI within notepad or another word editing program
 -Windows plays a sound every time you enter an entry
 -The first letter of text is cutoff in the GUI
