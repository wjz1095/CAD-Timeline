# CAD Timeline
Custom made CAD only for timeline tracking of events built in VB.net
 
It creates a text file in the directory you run the .exe from containing the entries you enter.
 
It timestamps any entries you make and automatically convert anything you enter into capital letters.
 
Issues:
* You cannot edit the files from within the GUI, you must edit them outside of the GUI within notepad or another word editing program
* Windows plays a sound every time you enter an entry
