This program is designed to make it easy to track events regardless of the type of event. It's by no means pretty, but it does its job and it does it well.

Very easy to use, lightweight, and portable with a size of 1MB and no installer!

On launch, it will ask you for an incident name, it then creates a text file in the directory you run the .exe from; anything you enter into the entry box will be converted to capital letters and then saved to that text file.

If you want to open a new incident, just click the green "New Incident" Button. It will open a new instance of the Timeline for you.

Closing one window will not close them all, so open and close as many as you want (within reason).

Font color and size are now adjustable at the top right of the Timeline for your pleasure.

<h4>Planned features:</h4>

* A button to open the entries using Notepad.exe so the user can edit it
* Have the main event display box just show the contents of the event file, and read from the file every time an entry is made so if a change is made externally it reflects inside the GUI
* See if I can make the event file editable from within the GUI. Possibly taking the contents of the main event display box and overwriting it into the event file

I'm always taking feedback and suggestions for new features, so if there's anything you'd like to see implemented, add a feature request under the Issues tab here https://github.com/wjz1095/CAD-Timeline/issues

<br>
<h4>Issues:</h4>

* You cannot edit the files from within the GUI, you must edit them outside of the GUI within notepad or another word editing program
* Any changes made to the file externally will not show from within the GUI currently
